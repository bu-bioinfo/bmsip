Although there has been tremendous progress in gene sequencing technologies to study cellular properties, organ
formation and disease pathogenesis, biomedical researchers mostly focus on limited datasets restricted to their
specialisations. We propose a meta-analysis framework to leverage information across vast gene expression datasets by
noise reduction and transcript alignment. This strategy could improve experimental design, reveal consensus gene
regulatory mechanisms of cellular processes, consolidate our knowledge on transcriptional changes, and unveil new
targets for detailed mechanistic studies. As proof-of-principle, we started this project using ~40 published
transcriptomic data sets from the brain-resident macrophages known as microglia, which we have been studying for over a
decade. Microglial cells undergo rapid context-dependent molecular and morphological changes in their subpopulations
during the lifespan of the organism and in disease. This project will identify core gene regulatory modules by comparing
gene datasets of proliferative and plastic cell types, to uncover novel genes, motifs or physiological contexts that
promote these cellular characteristics. As these cells exert positive (e.g., organ growth, recovery) or destructive
outcomes in various circumstances, the results may contribute towards precision therapy for wound healing, chronic
inflammation, and cancer.
