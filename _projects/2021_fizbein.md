Our lab uses a combination of high-throughput, functional genomics, bioinformatics and molecular approaches to study the
co-transcriptional gene regulation of mammalian expression programs. We recently observed that alternative transcription
start sites often arise close to annotated internal exons, creating “hybrid” exons that can be used as both terminal or
internal exons. This project involves the development of statistical tools and algorithms to analyze RNA-sequencing data
across different tissues, in order to characterize the features of hybrid exons. We will ask when and why hybrid exons
become hybrid? And, in which tissues are they used as terminal exons or internal exons? We will use machine learning to
investigate the sequences determinants of hybrid exons and single-cell RNA sequencing to explore whether hybrid exons
can be used as terminal and internal in the same cells.
