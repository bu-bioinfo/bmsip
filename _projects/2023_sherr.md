The projects are related to the molecular mechanisms through which an environmental chemical receptor, the AhR,
suppresses immune responses to oral and lung cancers. We have shown in cell lines and in mouse models that the AhR
influences expression of PD-L1 and other immune checkpoints that suppress tumor immunity. The AhR does this by
regulating expression of several genes known to be involved in cancer signaling. In general, we need computational
expertise to analyze multiple genomic data sets that we have accumulated in our lab and then to extrapolate the results
to the human condition by mining, for example, human gene (TCGA) and protein (CPTAC) data sets.
