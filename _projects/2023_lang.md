We are examining how upstream factors regulate genes through genetic enhancers and at steps after RNA transcription to
control the levels of proteins involved with cell growth and differentiation in melanoma and melanocytes. We examine
pathways in normal melanocytes and in transformed melanoctyes that give rise to melanoma cells. This internship will
address 1) what DNA regulatory sites are regulated by YAP and TAZ, to control downstream genes with transcriptional
cofactors. 2) How is PAX3 regulating gene expression through acting as an upstream transcription factor and
post-transcriptionally by interacting with RNA binding proteins to regulate RNA splicing and regulation.
