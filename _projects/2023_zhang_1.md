This internship is in collaboration with the Chobanian & Avedisian School of
Medicine [Data Science Core](https://www.bumc.bu.edu/camed/research/cores/data-science-core-dsc/)

This project involves analyzing existing and ongoing datasets from mouse and monkey brains to identify transcriptional
markers of aging and Alzheimer's disease, and to better understand the relationship between healthy aging and
Alzheimer's disease. We have generated several datasets from different mouse and monkey brain regions in various
projects related to the aforementioned tasks. We need to analyze these datasets using standard scRNASeq analysis
packages such as Seurat in R or Scanpy in Python. The intern will be responsible for not only discovering the biological
markers related to healthy aging or Alzheimer's disease, but also comparing the results from the two tasks.
