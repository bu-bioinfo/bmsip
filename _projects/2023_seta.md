This project is focused on understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of aortic aneurysms, vascular conditions
that can lead to death when they suddenly dissect/rupture. We identified sirtuin-1 as a key protein involved in the
protection of the aortic wall against aortic dissection/rupture, via its potent anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant
effects. Therefore, sirtuin-1 is a promising therapeutic target to prevent dissection/rupture in individuals with aortic
aneurysms. However, we still need to fully understand the signaling pathways activated by sirtuin-1 mediating its
beneficial effects.
