Preclinical stages of Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) affect only specific neurons. Neurons from layer II of the entorhinal
cortex (ECII), key to new memory formation, are the first ones to form neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and to degenerate.
A subset of these, in the transentorhinal cortex (TEC) strikingly form NFTs before the rest of EC. The TEC is much more
developed in humans than in mice, and virtually nothing is known about it other than its vulnerability to the disease.
AD itself is a very human specific disease: while certain features of the disease appear spontaneously in some species
and can be modeled in transgenic mice, the specific degeneration of EC/TEC cells only occurs in humans.

We have previously studied extensively the molecular profile of ECII neurons in the mouse, and have used functional
genomics to model these neurons in silico. We identified genes that could drive their vulnerability. We also used
single-nucleus RNAseq in the mouse to study subpopulations of ECII neurons and potentially identify the elusive mouse
homolog of TEC neurons. Lastly we recently generated a human single-nucleus RNAseq data of human EC. We think that a
cross species comparison might help us identify genes that could be key to drive the pathology in human ECII neurons. We
are also very interested in the possibility that TEC neurons could have represented a specific human evolutionary
innovation.

In this project, we will integrate our mouse and human single-nucleus RNAseq data using softwares like LIGER or Seurat
to help identify in the human dataset the homologs of the mouse subpopulations.
