In this project we analyze DNA and iPSCs derived from 23 members of an Israeli kindred with an inherited form of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease caused by the E200K mutation. Two mutation carriers from this kindred lived into their 90s,
many standard deviations beyond the typical age of disease onset and death (~55 years old). We hypothesize that these
“super-resilient” individuals harbor one or a small number of gene variants that provide a powerful disease-protective
effect. We aim to identify these variants using whole-exome sequence data we have obtained from all members of this
family. We will also be obtaining WES data from several families in which a parent and child are both E200K carriers,
but the parent is super-resilient, while the child is not. These will be particularly helpful in identifying protective
gene variants.
