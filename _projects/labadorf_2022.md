Graph databases encode data as sets of entities and relationships between them. 'omics datasets, including
genomic, transcriptomic, methylomic, proteomic, etc quantify many different types of biological entities like genes,
proteins, and metabolites. The entities captured by each of these data modalities partially overlap. Furthermore, 'omics
data generated from human subjects comprise a dataset where each individual has data points for each of these entities
for each modality as well as clinical information. Integrating these large, complex, and diverse data is a substantial
challenge. This project explores strategies for encoding 'omics data features and clinical variables for a set of
individuals who donated their brains to a local brain bank.
