AL amyloidosis and multiple myeloma are both cancers of antibody-secreting plasma cells. A subset of plasma cell cancers
secrete unstable antibody light chains, which can aggregate as insoluble amyloid fibrils, leading to progressive and
eventually fatal tissue damage. We are interested in understanding the differences between the antibody proteins that
influence whether amyloidosis will occur, and the differences between the plasma cells that secrete them. We will use
protein sequence analysis to look at the light chains, and high throughput gene expression data to look at the cells
which secrete them. The intern will analyze Amyloidosis Centerâ€™s database of disease-associated antibody light chain
sequences (~4000 unique antibody sequences) using the Observed Antibody Space repertoire sequencing database (~108
antibody sequences), and the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation CoMMpass RNA-sequencing datasets.
