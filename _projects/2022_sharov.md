To study stem-cell driven epithelial tissue regeneration, we need to understand how keratinocytes establish distinct
gene expression programs during differentiation, and why these programs are altered in pathological conditions
associated with stem cell exhausting/loss (aging) or uncontrolled expansion (cancer). Epigenetic mechanisms regulate
covalent DNA/histone modifications and higher-order chromatin remodeling. Terminal cell differentiation program is
maintained via interaction of the promoters of actively transcribed genes with their distal enhancer elements, which
provide functional and structural frameworks for cell-specific transcription controlled by lineage-specific
transcription factors.  

Although most genetic and epigenetic studies focus on protein-coding genes, regulation of the non-coding genome is
emerging as a new critical component in skin biology. Transposable elements (TEs) constitute a large portion (>44%-55%)
of the entire mouse or human genomes, respectively. We use mouse skin as primary research model. We hypothesized that
distinct classes of TEs differentially contribute to the control of gene expression in epidermal keratinocytes, mediated
by epigenetic regulators LSH and SETDB1 that serve as critical determinants mediating the TE silencing and preventing
pro-inflammatory responses in the epidermis. The short-term goal of the summer research program is to characterize
epigenetic changes in mouse keratinocytes isolated from Lsh and Setdb1 knockout mice. We are planning to perform
bioinformatic analysis of our own NGS available data using RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, WGBS, ChIP-seq, Chromatin Conformation
Capture (HiC) pipelines.
