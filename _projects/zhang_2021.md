Chronic alcohol consumption can result in alcohol use disorder (AUD), but the underlying mechanisms are not well
understood. We hypothesized that long-term alcohol use could alter the expression of coding genes (or mRNAs) and
noncoding genes (such as long noncoding RNAs) in the brain, thus promoting neuroadaptation to alcohol. The project aims
to identify differentially expressed long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in specific brain regions of subjects with AUD. In
addition, the interactive effect of mRNAs and lncRNAs on the risk of AUD will be studied. Ribo-depleted RNA-Seq data
from 192 AUD and matched healthy control post mortem human brain tissue samples spanning 8 brain regions will be
analyzed.
