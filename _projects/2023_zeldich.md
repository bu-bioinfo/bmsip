Abnormal oligodendrocyte differentiation and deficient myelin production were recently identified as potential
contributors to development of intellectual disability, a devastating hallmark of Down Syndrome (DS). The presence of an
extra chromosome and the triplication of specific genes exerts global changes in the transcriptomic and epigenetic
landscape that interfere with the fundamental establishment and development of central nervous system cells. We will be
using cortical organoids in vitro system generated from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell to examine how
changes in the epigenetic machinery alter oligodendrocyte biology in Down Syndrome. The internship will address how the
DS-associated epigenetic landscape shapes the developmental and functional trajectories of oligodendrocytes and other
cell types populating cortical organoids. We plan to uncover how the presence of additional chromosome 21 affects
transcriptional dynamics and accessibility of chromatin in DS.
