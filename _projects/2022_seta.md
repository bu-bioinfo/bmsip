Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in USA. Dr Setaâ€™s research focuses on
cellular and molecular mechanisms of vascular diseases, with the goal of identifying novel therapeutic targets. Ongoing
studies are examining the role of the transcription factor Bcl11b and the enzyme sirtuin-1 on the development of aortic
aneurysms, abnormal aortic dilations for which there is no targeted therapies. We found that both proteins are
protective against aortic aneurysms, as demonstrated in mice with Bcl11b or Sirtuin-1 deletion, which develop aortic
aneurysms or ruptures when treated with the hypertensive agent angiotensin II (see Valisno et al Circ Research 2021 and
Fry et al, JAHA 2015). However, the molecular mechanisms by which these proteins exert their beneficial effects is
elusive. To address this, we ran both RNA sequencing and proteomics analysis on aortas from angII-treated controls and
mice with either Bcl11b or sirtuin1 deletions to identify downstream transcriptomics and proteomics pathways. We would
like to analyze these datasets and possibly integrate them to identify the molecular pathways involved in the formation
of aortic aneurysms.
