This internship is in collaboration with the Chobanian & Avedisian School of
Medicine [Data Science Core](https://www.bumc.bu.edu/camed/research/cores/data-science-core-dsc/)

The development of Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) can span many years and the disease currently lacks effective treatments.
Identifying people with risk in cognitive decline and progression to AD at the early stage may enable earlier
intervention and better prognosis via modifiable risk factors and therefore reduce the disease burden. This internship
will advance the study that develops natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning models to harmonize data
from different resources.
