This project focuses on solid cancer tissues that display a complex structural architecture with both cellular and
non-cellular components. By creating super-resolved spatial datasets with a resolution at the single transcript level (~
150 nm) we can distinguish both cancer and non-cancer cells, including immune, adipocytes and stromal cells, organized
within small niches and larger tissue structures. In addition to the transcript coordinate information, obtained from
500 unique genes, the datasets also contain immuno-fluorescence image stains that mark the cellular nucleus and cellular
components. Most of our spatial datasets are from primary tumor samples obtained from patients at Boston Medical Center
and diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer, which is the most aggressive form of breast cancer and known to be
very heterogeneous.
