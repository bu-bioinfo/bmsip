This internship is in collaboration with the Chobanian & Avedisian School of
Medicine [Data Science Core](https://www.bumc.bu.edu/camed/research/cores/data-science-core-dsc/)

The development of Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) can span many years before symptom manifestation and clinical diagnosis.
Effective treatments for AD are considered controversial and only minimally slow down progression. Assessing and
identifying people with risk in cognitive decline and progression along the AD disease continuum may enable earlier
intervention and better prognosis via modifiable risk factors and therefore reduce the disease burden. This internship
will work on developing interpretable machine learning for risk prediction in AD progression.
