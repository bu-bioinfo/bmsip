This internship is in collaboration with the Chobanian & Avedisian School of
Medicine [Data Science Core](https://www.bumc.bu.edu/camed/research/cores/data-science-core-dsc/)

My lab and my collaborator's lab have generated single-cell RNA sequencing data using the recently published
sci-RNA-seq3 protocol. However, unlike well-established commercial protocols like the 10X platform, there is no
comprehensive package available to process the data. This internship will establish a computational pipeline to process
the raw data, perform comprehensive quality control, and convert the data to a standard format.
