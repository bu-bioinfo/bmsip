Changes in the aged brain that occur with stroke, head injury or Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Related Dementias result in chronic
cognitive and motor deficits. We have shown that mesenchymal stem cells-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) enhance
recovery of motor function following cortical injury in aged female monkeys. EVs reduced injury-induced including
microglial neuroinflammation, neuronal excitotoxicity, synapse loss, oligodendrocyte damage, and myelination deficits.
However, the molecular mechanisms, through which EVs promote therapeutic effects on different populations of brain cells
following cortical injury are unknown. This internship will address how the treatment with EVs following injury affects
the recovery of the brain at the level of a single-cell resolution. Brain samples of rhesus monkeys treated and
untreated with EVs will be analyzed. The results will contribute to the development of new therapeutic approaches based
on the utilization of EVs.
