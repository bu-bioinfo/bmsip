                BMSIP is a match making program that connects BU biological and biomedical investigators with BU
                Bioinformatics MS students seeking internships to complete their degree. Mentorship and project
                oversight is provided by a staff bioinformatics scientist in collaboration with the PI. Projects
                are chosen by a competitive proposal process in the spring and commence in the summer. The
                Bioinformatics Program provides stipends to interns and salary support for bioinformatics mentors.
                See <a href="how_it_works.html">How It Works</a> for more detailed information on the program.

                BMSIP was created in 2021 as a collaboration between the BU Bioinformatics MS Program and the
                <a href="https://www.bumc.bu.edu/gsi/">Genome Science Institute (GSI)</a> at the BU School of Medicine.
                The bioinformatics skills taught by the MS program synergize with the GSI's mission to promote the
                practice of genomics at BU.
